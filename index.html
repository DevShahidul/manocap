                            ManoCap began investing in Sierra Leone in 2006. Since then we have seen first-hand the opportunities that exist in frontier markets, the significant development impact that business can have and, importantly, the risks that can cause long term harm to investors capital.

                        <p>Building on that experience we now focus on two things: growing our portfolio of investments and advising others (development finance institutions, fund managers, corporations and development institutions) on how to invest their capital.</p>

                                ManoCap invests its own capital, alongside third party investors, in a portfolio of businesses that we plan to own for the long term.  Our portfolio represents both the successes we have had and the lessons we have learnt.  Most importantly we now work with a group of managers that we know and trust.

                                <p>Today, our objective is to build our portfolio organically, while identifying new opportunities to put money to work.  We are looking to identify investments with the following characteristics:
</p>
                                <ul>
									<li>Operating in sectors that we understand and where we can add value</li>
									<li>Businesses with high growth potential and a significant competitive advantage</li>
									<li>Management teams we know and trust</li>
									<li>Businesses where we can maximise our stake</li>
									<li>Pricing that reflects a significant margin of safety</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p>Our aim is to maximise returns to investors while taking as little risk as possible.  In frontier markets, crisis is the norm.  We look to work with businesses that are robust enough to thrive in such an environment, and work with managers with the integrity and ability to be effective in both good times and bad.</p>
                                <p>We do this because we believe that businesses have a significant impact in improving peoples’ lives – either by creating jobs or providing goods and services that are needed by the poor.</p>

                            We do what we do because we believe that businesses have a significant impact in improving peoples’ lives – either by creating jobs or providing goods and services that are needed by the poor. 
                        </div>
                        <p>Over the last 10 years our investments have provided over 60% of the fish sold in Sierra Leone (fish makes up 80% of the protein intake of the country), enabled payments to health care workers during the Ebola outbreak and facilitated the establishment of new agricultural projects.  All of the businesses in which we invest, must demonstrably deliver positive impact in the countries in which they work</p>
                        <p>In addition, over the last 10 years, ManoCap has established two charities that work in areas in which our team has a strong personal interest.
